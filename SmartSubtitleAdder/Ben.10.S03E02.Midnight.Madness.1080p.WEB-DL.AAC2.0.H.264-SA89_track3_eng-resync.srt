I am about to take you on a
journey through that mysterious

First, i shall require some
volunteers.

you.
>> me? Forget it!

Afraid you don't have half a
brain?

33
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:50,900
>> now, clear your minds.
Focus only on this pocket watch
as it swings back and forth.

34
00:04:50,901 --> 00:05:11,986
Your eyelids are feeling heavy.
You are falling into a deep
sleep.

>>
>> major blackmail time.
>> now you are in my power.

will all become newborn babies.

chicken?

Your will is my command.

>> wait. Wait.
Here's my favorite part.
>> more grapes, master?

46

>> hey, take it easy.
You're gonna give me split ends.

47
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,124
>> what?
What just happened?
>> too bad you snapped out of

48
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:57,226
It when the omnitrix timed out.
I was going to have you do a
hot oil conditioning treatment

49
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:00,527
Next.
>> yeah?
Well, that's why they created

Erase buttons.
>> give that back!
>> all right, that's a wrap on

It's been a long day, and we
could all use some shut-eye.

Lights out.
>> why can't you just leave me
alone?

53

>> doofus.
>> uh.

54
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:36,675
>> hey, you ok, ben?
You don't seem as peppy as
usual.

55
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:45,873
>> just a little tired, that's
all.
>> whoa. What happened?

56
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,237
>> somebody stole the motor
from the sea dragon ride.
Probably a prank by some punk

57
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:56,928
Kids.
>> what do you make of this?
>> what? I didn't do it.

58
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:06,478
I swear.
Hey, i'm not the only alien in
the galaxy, you know.

59
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:23,943
>> uh, ben, where are you going
at this time of night?

60
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:33,749
Hello. Earth to doofus.
I asked you a question.
Wait. You can't go out like

61
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:52,497
That.
>> he must be sleepwalking.
>> halt in the name of mall

62
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:58,265
Security!

63
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:19,128
>> ben, wake up!
You're sleepwalking!
>> it's no use, gwen.

64
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,492
He can't hear you.
He probably has no idea what
he's doing.

65
00:09:22,494 --> 00:10:01,012
>> so what else is new?
>> i'd better get up there.
>>

66
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:25,239
>> look!
>> time sure flies when you go
alien.

67
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:29,116
>> who are you?
What happened to the guy that
looked like a walking

68
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:32,194
Chandelier?
Oh, well.
Who cares, as long as you do

69
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:49,146
What i say?
Now get out of here before the
cops see you!

70
00:10:49,148 --> 00:11:01,484
>> oh, man, what a weird dream.
Whoa! Oh, man!
>> despite last night's bizarre

71
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:05,330
Attack and other burglaries,
the mall representative had
this to say.

72
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,341
>> this was an isolated
incident.
The mall is open for business.

73
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:14,783
Shopper safety is our number
one priority.
>> so why would i go alien and

74
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:19,461
Then steal bizarre stuff like a
rollercoaster motor and a big
clock?

75
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:24,397
>> well, sleepwalkers are in a
hyper dream state.
Nothing makes sense in a dream.

76
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,197
>> yeah, but most sleepwalkers
don't have a watch full of
alien heroes at their control.

77
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:34,684
>> well, gwen's got a point.
We're gonna have to keep you
awake and away from people

78
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:43,304
Until we can figure out how to
stop your midnight strolls.
>> hey! What'd you do that for?

79
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:56,603
>> just doing my job.
>> aah!
Aah!

80
00:11:56,605 --> 00:12:01,378
Ahh!
Hey, you're enjoying this,
aren't you?

81
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,300
>> now, why would you say that?
>> grandpa, wake up.

82
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:19,837
It's your shift.
>> awake, my slaves.

83
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:40,827
Awake and serve your master
sublimino.
>> gwen, turn down the heat,

84
00:12:40,829 --> 00:13:01,113
Will you?
I'm cooking over here.
Ben!

85
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:08,997
Ben, listen to me.
You've got to snap out of this.
>> you're under some kind of

86
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:25,372
Hypnotic spell or something.
>> you two, get away from that
thing.

87
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:34,602
Everybody out. Move! Move! Move!
>> this was an isolated
incident.

88

The mall is open for business.
Shopper safety is our number
one priority.

89
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:46,042
>> so sublimino plants post-
hypnotic suggestions in his
volunteers, turning them into

90
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:50,497
His army of thieves.
>> but the sound of the
omnitrix timing out snaps ben

91
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:58,829
Out of the trance.
>> aah! But why have me steal

92
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:04,309
All that weird stuff?
>> i don't know, but sublimino
sure does.

93
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:08,507
We need to find him, and fast.
>> this was an isolated

It's showtime.

Where's gwen?
>> oh, mom, i'm too tired to go

101

To school.
>> i've got the perfect
solution to your sleepwalking

102
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:53,820
Problem.
If you can't touch the
omnitrix, you can't go alien.

103
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:58,147
>> where'd you get those?
>> survivalists "r" us.
They have a very extensive

104

Selection.
>> i don't know about this,
gwen.

Realm known as the mind.
No need to volunteer.
Now all of you will obey me

A giant hypno-watch?

111
00:15:47,211 --> 00:16:00,477
Ha!
No way that'll ever work.
Or maybe it will.

Don't look at the clock.
Don't look at the clock.

Obey me.
I command you, obey me!

Don't just stand there.
Stop that plant thing.

Grandpa! Gwen!
Hang on.
Whoa!

Going up.
Show's over.

You're all free!
>> no, no, no!
It isn't fair.

127

>> now who's the baby?
>> looks like your time is up.
>> nice job, ben. Ben?

128

You are falling into a

Deep sleep.
>> hey, ben, what are you doing
back there?

130
00:20:41,686 --> 00:20:51,971

You are now completely under

Your wish is my command.

Now, get me some ice cream.
>> yes, master.
