journey through that mysterious

volunteers.

you.

Afraid you don't have half a
brain?

33
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:02,401
>> now, clear your minds.
Focus only on this pocket watch
as it swings back and forth.

34
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:24,356
Your eyelids are feeling heavy.
You are falling into a deep
sleep.

>>
>> major blackmail time.
>> now you are in my power.

will all become newborn babies.

chicken?

Your will is my command.

>> wait. Wait.
Here's my favorite part.
>> more grapes, master?

46

>> hey, take it easy.
You're gonna give me split ends.

47
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:09,661
>> what?
What just happened?
>> too bad you snapped out of

48
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:13,932
It when the omnitrix timed out.
I was going to have you do a
hot oil conditioning treatment

49
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,369
Next.
>> yeah?
Well, that's why they created

50

Erase buttons.
>> give that back!
>> all right, that's a wrap on

It's been a long day, and we
could all use some shut-eye.

Lights out.
>> why can't you just leave me
alone?

53

>> doofus.
>> uh.

54
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:55,006
>> hey, you ok, ben?
You don't seem as peppy as
usual.

55
00:07:55,008 --> 00:08:04,583
>> just a little tired, that's
all.
>> whoa. What happened?

56
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:08,086
>> somebody stole the motor
from the sea dragon ride.
Probably a prank by some punk

57
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:16,094
Kids.
>> what do you make of this?
>> what? I didn't do it.

58
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:26,037
I swear.
Hey, i'm not the only alien in
the galaxy, you know.

59
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:44,222
>> uh, ben, where are you going
at this time of night?

60
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:54,432
Hello. Earth to doofus.
I asked you a question.
Wait. You can't go out like

61
00:08:54,434 --> 00:09:13,952
That.
>> he must be sleepwalking.
>> halt in the name of mall

62
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:19,958
Security!

63
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:41,680
>> ben, wake up!
You're sleepwalking!
>> it's no use, gwen.

64
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:45,183
He can't hear you.
He probably has no idea what
he's doing.

65
00:09:45,185 --> 00:10:25,290
>> so what else is new?
>> i'd better get up there.
>>

66
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:50,515
>> look!
>> time sure flies when you go
alien.

67
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:54,552
>> who are you?
What happened to the guy that
looked like a walking

68
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,756
Chandelier?
Oh, well.
Who cares, as long as you do

69
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:15,407
What i say?
Now get out of here before the
cops see you!

70
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:28,253
>> oh, man, what a weird dream.
Whoa! Oh, man!
>> despite last night's bizarre

71
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:32,257
Attack and other burglaries,
the mall representative had
this to say.

72
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,393
>> this was an isolated
incident.
The mall is open for business.

73
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:42,100
Shopper safety is our number
one priority.
>> so why would i go alien and

74
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:46,971
Then steal bizarre stuff like a
rollercoaster motor and a big
clock?

75
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:52,110
>> well, sleepwalkers are in a
hyper dream state.
Nothing makes sense in a dream.

76
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:58,149
>> yeah, but most sleepwalkers
don't have a watch full of
alien heroes at their control.

77
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:02,821
>> well, gwen's got a point.
We're gonna have to keep you
awake and away from people

78
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:11,796
Until we can figure out how to
stop your midnight strolls.
>> hey! What'd you do that for?

79
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:25,643
>> just doing my job.
>> aah!
Aah!

80
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:30,615
Ahh!
Hey, you're enjoying this,
aren't you?

81
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:37,822
>> now, why would you say that?
>> grandpa, wake up.

82
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:49,834
It's your shift.
>> awake, my slaves.

83
00:12:49,836 --> 00:13:11,689
Awake and serve your master
sublimino.
>> gwen, turn down the heat,

84
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:32,811
Will you?
I'm cooking over here.
Ben!

85
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:41,019
Ben, listen to me.
You've got to snap out of this.
>> you're under some kind of

86
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:58,069
Hypnotic spell or something.
>> you two, get away from that
thing.

87
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:07,679
Everybody out. Move! Move! Move!
>> this was an isolated
incident.

88

The mall is open for business.
Shopper safety is our number
one priority.

89
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:19,591
>> so sublimino plants post-
hypnotic suggestions in his
volunteers, turning them into

90
00:14:19,593 --> 00:14:24,229
His army of thieves.
>> but the sound of the
omnitrix timing out snaps ben

91
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:32,904
Out of the trance.
>> aah! But why have me steal

92
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:38,610
All that weird stuff?
>> i don't know, but sublimino
sure does.

93
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:42,981
We need to find him, and fast.
>> this was an isolated

It's showtime.

Where's gwen?
>> oh, mom, i'm too tired to go

101

To school.
>> i've got the perfect
solution to your sleepwalking

102
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:30,161
Problem.
If you can't touch the
omnitrix, you can't go alien.

103
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:34,666
>> where'd you get those?
>> survivalists "r" us.
They have a very extensive

Selection.
>> i don't know about this,
gwen.

No need to volunteer.
Now all of you will obey me

A giant hypno-watch?

111
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:39,564
Ha!
No way that'll ever work.
Or maybe it will.

Obey me.
I command you, obey me!

Hang on.
Whoa!

>> now who's the baby?
>> looks like your time is up.
>> nice job, ben. Ben?

You are falling into a

Deep sleep.
>> hey, ben, what are you doing
back there?

130

You are now completely under

Your wish is my command.
