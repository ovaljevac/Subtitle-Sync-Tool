9
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:36,561
Make one without a cake

10
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:38,999
>> uh, excuse me, full-time hero
here.

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,372
When do i have time to go get
some dumb old cake?

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,515
You were supposed to do it.
Anyway, it's no big deal.

13
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:46,856
>> for grandpa it is.
>> fine!

14
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:50,930

>> i don't have time for this!
>> so when can you catch me up

You know.
Wait a minute.

Do i have a master's?
>> look, i didn't bring you here

59
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,910
To find out about your future.
I came back to bring ben.

60
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,733
>> so, why nab me?
>> i remembered ben's listening

61
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:18,550
Skills sort of stunk.
Grabbing you was the only way i

62
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,891
Knew he'd come.
>> so time-travel is no big deal

63
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:22,976
Now?
>> you just need to know the

64
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:25,574
Right spell to create the right
kind of portal.

00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,589
>> i know magic?
How wicked is that!

66
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:32,534
What else do i know how to do?
Did i ever get my black belt?

67

>> hello!
Forget you.

All the time.

Me need anyway?
>> ben 10,000 may have mastered

73
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,944
The secrets of the omnitrix, but
it still doesn't make him

74
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:53,510
Prepared for everything.
There's a crisis looming even he

75
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:55,851
Can't solve alone.
>> danger alert!

Samples from across the galaxy.
>> dr. Animo!

79
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,418
That's the crisis, right?
That's why i'm here.

80
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,209
He made that robot-rhino dude,
and now he's doing something

81
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:14,390
Else.
It's time to give the doctor a

82
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:18,527
Double-dose of ben medicine.
Come on, i'll give us a lift.

83
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,773
Aw, man!
Can't this thing power up faster

84
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:29,432
In the future?
>> ooh!

85
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:32,030
>> gwendolyn, i thought that was
you.

86
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:35,141
>> and us.
>> well, i see someone finally

87
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:37,579
Figured out how to work their
time portal.

00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:41,235
>> grandpa!
>> now this is what i call a

89
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:46,270
Great gift, seeing you 2 again.

00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,349
>> well, i--i see gwendolyn a
lot.

91
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:52,782
>> it's great seeing you, too.
But the same shirt?

92
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:56,694
Grandpa, it was 20 years out of
style 20 years ago.

93
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,902
>> hey, when you find a look
that works.

94
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:06,157

It's totally teched-out.
>> you ain't seen nothin' yet!

97
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:28,287
Hit it, grandpa.
>> so, where do i sleep?

98
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:31,045
>> in your fancy headquarters.
Where else?

99
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:33,258
You're too good to stay with us
anymore.

100
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:39,705
>> guess you just have other
priorities.

101
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:44,965
Well, here we are.
>> you coming, grandpa?

102
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,621
>> oh, no, no.
You haven't needed my help for

103
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:53,144
A long time.
Just make sure you say good-bye

104
00:07:53,146 --> 00:08:00,841
Before gwendolyn sends you back.
>> time to go four arms and show

105
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:06,454
Ben 10,000 where it all begins.

108
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:28,424
>> oh, i was gonna go four arms,
too.

109
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:32,561
Great minds must think alike.
>> i don't think so.

110
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:44,204
Now go!
>> no one is going anywhere!

111
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:49,753
>> i see you brought help.
You're going to need it.

112
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:54,372
For every one of your 10,000
heroes, i will steal enough dna

113
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:59,183
To create 10,000 monstrous
minions.

114
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:05,309
>> oh, yeah?
Think again.

115

117
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,967
>> shouldn't we help or
something?

118
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:36,131
>> no. He prefers it this way.
>> hey, i'm missing all the

119
00:09:36,133 --> 00:10:08,654
Action.
>> wow! I rock!

120
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:11,315
What do you call that other one?
Loogie man?

121
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:13,496
Spitter?
>> they're not pets!

122
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:19,238
I don't name them anymore.
>> aw, but that was half the

123
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:27,673
Fun.
>> aah!

124
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:30,945
>> did we detect a cry for help?
The galactic enforcers have

125
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:38,803
Arrived.
>> show's over, guys.

126
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,818
>> it's a big world, ben.
You could always save a couple

127
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,870
Of the bad guys for us, you
know.

128
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:47,463
>> what would be the point?
But since you're here, how about

129
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:51,632
Bringing animo back to the
null-void chamber for me.

130
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:57,726
>> yeah, sure.
Anything to help.

131
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:07,509
>> gwendolyn, i'll meet you back
at headquarters.

132
00:11:07,511 --> 00:11:12,320
>> guess you got me now.
There's nothing i can do.

133
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:15,976
Heh heh.
>> so animo's been around this

134
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:18,670
Whole time?
>> he escaped a few years back.

135
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:21,942
I wasn't sure if he was going to
show his ugly face again.

136
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:24,507
But now, it looks like he won't
be a problem anymore.

137
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,195
>> woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.
>> what about vilgax?

138
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,243
>> last i saw of him, i left him
in pieces.

139
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:34,290
It wasn't pretty for anyone.
'nuff said.

140
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:43,367
>> whoa, i really need to
lighten up.

141
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:59,564
>> mr. Vilgax, so nice you could

00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:04,792
Rejoin me.
>> whoa!

143
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:07,326
This is my headquarters?
Awesome!

144
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:10,404
I must chill out here a lot.
>> there's no time.

145
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:14,349
I'm always patrolling the
planet, thus, ben has no need to

146
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,551
Hang out here.
>> ok, tell me i didn't just

147
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:22,239
Say, "thus."
don't i have any fun anymore?

148
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,858
>> you'll learn soon enough,
being me is not about fun.

149
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,855
Now wait here for gwendolyn, and
don't touch a thing!

150
00:12:32,857 --> 00:12:36,480
>> hey, look
>> he said not to touch

151
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,853
Anything.
>> why should i listen to me?

152
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:42,702
You never do.
>> hey!

153
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,466
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

154
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:48,058
Whoa-ho!
Guess i should have told her to

Thought.
Cool move, huh?

Want to race?
>> no!

160
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,223
Those days are over.
>> well, what i'm over is being

A hero if this is how i turn

162
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:09,227
I am such a jerk!

Aliens...
And had animo program their

186
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:55,816
Moves into my new dna.

00:16:36,744 --> 00:16:39,949
Void and yourselves at the same
time.

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,735
What ben tennyson can do?
I just hope after all this time,
