9
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:37,503
Make one without a cake

10
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,039
>> uh, excuse me, full-time hero
here.

11
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,508
When do i have time to go get
some dumb old cake?

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,778
You were supposed to do it.
Anyway, it's no big deal.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,213
>> for grandpa it is.
>> fine!

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:52,451

This is so cool that i'm so
cool!

>> i don't have time for this!
>> so when can you catch me up

You know.
Wait a minute.

Do i have a master's?
>> look, i didn't bring you here

59
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,955
To find out about your future.
I came back to bring ben.

60
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,892
>> so, why nab me?
>> i remembered ben's listening

61
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,862
Skills sort of stunk.
Grabbing you was the only way i

62
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,298
Knew he'd come.
>> so time-travel is no big deal

63
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,467
Now?
>> you just need to know the

64
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,170
Right spell to create the right
kind of portal.

65
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,306
>> i know magic?
How wicked is that!

66
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:45,410
What else do i know how to do?
Did i ever get my black belt?

67

>> hello!
Forget you.

All the time.

Me need anyway?
>> ben 10,000 may have mastered

73
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,563
The secrets of the omnitrix, but
it still doesn't make him

74
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,232
Prepared for everything.
There's a crisis looming even he

75
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,668
Can't solve alone.
>> danger alert!

Samples from across the galaxy.
>> dr. Animo!

79
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,782
That's the crisis, right?
That's why i'm here.

80
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,685
He made that robot-rhino dude,
and now he's doing something

81
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,954
Else.
It's time to give the doctor a

82
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:33,258
Double-dose of ben medicine.
Come on, i'll give us a lift.

83
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,594
Aw, man!
Can't this thing power up faster

84
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:44,603
In the future?
>> ooh!

85
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,305
>> gwendolyn, i thought that was
you.

86
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,542
>> and us.
>> well, i see someone finally

87
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,078
Figured out how to work their
time portal.

88
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,882
>> grandpa!
>> now this is what i call a

89
00:06:56,884 --> 00:07:02,120
Great gift, seeing you 2 again.

>> well, i--i see gwendolyn a
lot.

91
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,894
>> it's great seeing you, too.
But the same shirt?

92
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,964
Grandpa, it was 20 years out of
style 20 years ago.

93
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,301
>> hey, when you find a look
that works.

94
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:22,808

It's totally teched-out.
>> you ain't seen nothin' yet!

97
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:45,831
Hit it, grandpa.
>> so, where do i sleep?

98
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,700
>> in your fancy headquarters.
Where else?

99
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,002
You're too good to stay with us
anymore.

100
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:57,709
>> guess you just have other
priorities.

101
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:03,181
Well, here we are.
>> you coming, grandpa?

102
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,985
>> oh, no, no.
You haven't needed my help for

103
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,690
A long time.
Just make sure you say good-bye

104
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:19,698
Before gwendolyn sends you back.
>> time to go four arms and show

105
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,537
Ben 10,000 where it all begins.
>> aargh!

106
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,839

108
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,393
>> oh, i was gonna go four arms,
too.

109
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:52,697
Great minds must think alike.
>> i don't think so.

110
00:08:52,699 --> 00:09:04,809
Now go!
>> no one is going anywhere!

111
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,582
>> i see you brought help.
You're going to need it.

112
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:15,387
For every one of your 10,000
heroes, i will steal enough dna

113
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:20,392
To create 10,000 monstrous
minions.

114
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:26,765
>> oh, yeah?
Think again.

115

117
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,458
>> shouldn't we help or
something?

118
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,830
>> no. He prefers it this way.
>> hey, i'm missing all the

119
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:32,664
Action.
>> wow! I rock!

120
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,433
What do you call that other one?
Loogie man?

121
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,702
Spitter?
>> they're not pets!

122
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:43,675
I don't name them anymore.
>> aw, but that was half the

123
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:52,450
Fun.
>> aah!

124
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,854
>> did we detect a cry for help?
The galactic enforcers have

125
00:10:55,856 --> 00:11:04,029
Arrived.
>> show's over, guys.

126
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:07,165
>> it's a big world, ben.
You could always save a couple

127
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,300
Of the bad guys for us, you
know.

128
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:13,038
>> what would be the point?
But since you're here, how about

129
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,375
Bringing animo back to the
null-void chamber for me.

130
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:23,715
>> yeah, sure.
Anything to help.

131
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:33,892
>> gwendolyn, i'll meet you back
at headquarters.

132
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:38,897
>> guess you got me now.
There's nothing i can do.

133
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,701
Heh heh.
>> so animo's been around this

134
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,503
Whole time?
>> he escaped a few years back.

135
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,907
I wasn't sure if he was going to
show his ugly face again.

136
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,576
But now, it looks like he won't
be a problem anymore.

137
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:55,413
>> woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.
>> what about vilgax?

138
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:58,583
>> last i saw of him, i left him
in pieces.

139
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,753
It wasn't pretty for anyone.
'nuff said.

140
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:11,196
>> whoa, i really need to
lighten up.

141
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:28,046
>> mr. Vilgax, so nice you could

142
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:33,485
Rejoin me.
>> whoa!

143
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,121
This is my headquarters?
Awesome!

144
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,324
I must chill out here a lot.
>> there's no time.

145
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:43,428
I'm always patrolling the
planet, thus, ben has no need to

146
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,799
Hang out here.
>> ok, tell me i didn't just

147
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,636
Say, "thus."
don't i have any fun anymore?

148
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:56,441
>> you'll learn soon enough,
being me is not about fun.

149
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:02,680
Now wait here for gwendolyn, and
don't touch a thing!

150
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:06,451
>> hey, look
>> he said not to touch

151
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,920
Anything.
>> why should i listen to me?

152
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,924
You never do.
>> hey!

153
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,759
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

154
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:18,496
Whoa-ho!
Guess i should have told her to

Thought.
Cool move, huh?

Want to race?
>> no!

160
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,313
Those days are over.
>> well, what i'm over is being

A hero if this is how i turn

162
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,518
I am such a jerk!

Aliens...
And had animo program their

186
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:33,825
Moves into my new dna.

00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,737
Void and yourselves at the same
time.

00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:04,248
What ben tennyson can do?
I just hope after all this time,
